React Starter
=====================

The minimal dev environment to enable live-editing React components.

### Usage

For now we did not use http server to run the project because we  use this with electron in our project. You can create your own dev http server right? :)

```
npm install
npm run webpack_build_dev
open index.html
```

### Dependencies

* React
* React-Router
* Webpack
* Babel-Loader
* CSS-Loader
