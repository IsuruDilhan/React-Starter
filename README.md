React Starter
=====================

A minimal starter kit for react based project.

### Usage

For now we did not use http server to run the project because we  use this with electron in our project. You can create your own dev http server right? :)

```
npm install
npm run webpack-build-dev
open index.html
```

### Dependencies

* React
* React-Router
* Webpack
* Babel-Loader
* CSS-Loader
